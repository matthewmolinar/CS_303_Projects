# strings in the reviews) with the value a list of length 2.
# Both elements of the list are integers.
# The first element in the list is the number of reviews that
# contain the word (key) and the second is the sum of all the
# review scores that contain the word (key). 
# 
# The second dictionary has keys that are also strings representing
# the number of words (any and all strings) in a review.
# So for example '12' if the review has 12 words. The value
# for each key is also a list of length 2.Just like the first
# dictionary the first element in the list is the number of reviews
# that contain the word (key) and the second is the sum of all the
# review scores that contain the word (key).
